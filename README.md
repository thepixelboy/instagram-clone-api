# FastAPI instagram clone project

We will create an Instagram clone app and build the API that is required to make that work. We will focus on a few key concepts like posting, commenting and user authentication. We will also develop two clients for our api:

- [web client in ReactJS](https://github.com/thepixelboy/instagram-clone-frontend)
- mobile client in Android and Kotlin

That way you will have a complete understanding both web and mobile fullstack development.

## Setup

- Clone the project
- Setup a virtual environment: `$ python3 -m venv venv`
- Start the API server: `$ uvicorn main:app --reload`
